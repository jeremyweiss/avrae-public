# Avrae Public
This repository is a copy of Avrae build 587, for public demonstration.
It is missing a number of files to actually run, and is not meant to be hosted locally.
## Web
The web interface can be found at ``/avrae-web/``.
## Notable Files
Some notable files are ``/cogs5e/funcs/dice.py``, which powers the entire dice rolling system, ``/cogs5e/sheets/dicecloud.py``, which pulls character sheet information from Dicecloud, and ``/cogs5e/models/character.py``, which is the Character model that powers much of the character tracking system.
